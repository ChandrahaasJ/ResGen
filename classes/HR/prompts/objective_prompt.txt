Candidate's answer to "Tell me about yourself":

    Good morning, and thank you for the opportunity to be here.
    My name is Y Sai Vineel, and I’m currently in my second year of B.Tech in Computer Science with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at KMIT. Over the past two years, I’ve developed a strong foundation in programming, software development, and analytical thinking. I’m proficient in C++, Python, and JavaScript, and I’ve applied these skills in projects like an AI-powered nutrition estimator that combines computer vision and machine learning to analyze food images.
    In addition to my technical background, I actively contribute to RITI – The Upcycling Club at my college. Being part of the organizing committee has helped me sharpen my leadership, event planning, and team collaboration skills.
    I’m particularly drawn to opportunities that blend real-world impact with technology—especially in AI, software development, and web technologies. I’m eager to work in a dynamic environment where I can continue to learn, take initiative, and contribute meaningfully.
    I’m someone who thrives in a team, adapts quickly to new challenges, and enjoys learning new tools and technologies. I’m truly excited about the possibility of bringing my skills and energy to your team.
    Thank you again for considering my application—I look forward to the conversation ahead
