{"Pravalika":"This is Pravalika and I am currently in my 3rd year of engineering in kmit. I’ve spent my college years learning new programming languages and experimenting with them through problem solving and projects. I have done 2 projects which come under generative ai domain. The first project’s chatbot for medical queries which focuses on giving day to day medical related information when asked by the user and to achieve that  my team and me have used an llm called Bert and rag for retrieval of the apt information. We have also used faiss that’s a Facebook ai similarly search it’s a library which helps mapping similar data together, by using both of them the retrieval process became accurate. The other project was called as FYI - for your information. This was a news generator which summarises different articles from different sources and gives you a better idea of the news topic, another feature was YouTube summarisation as well. These are the two projects I have done and I learnt a lot from these. I’ve learnt about llms, about front end, back end and all the different aspects of building a project. I am proficient in speaking skills and a good team spirit",
"Sathwik":"Hi, my name is billa choudhary, but you can call me the Billa of my domain — a specialist who doesn’t just follow paths, but creates them.Every step I take has purpose. Every challenge? Just another scene in my story. I walk with clarity, lead with precision, and bring a storm of skill wherever I go.aI'm not just part of a team; I’m the force that drives it forward — a one-man army when needed, but also someone who thrives in coordination. My passion for what I do? Electric. My execution? Lightning fast.I don’t fear problems; I neutralize them. I don’t just solve errors; I bury them deep in history. I’ve learned to stay calm in chaos, move smart in silence, and strike loud when it counts.My experience isn't just what's on paper — it's in every decision I’ve owned, every project I’ve led, and every outcome I’ve transformed.I’m here not just to contribute. I’m here to own, lead, and win.",
"Sandeep":"Hi, I’m Sandeep Reddy Ade.I’m originally from Chennai, born on March 25th. I enjoy simple things like eating and sleeping — but my passion lies in AI and fashion tech.I studied at FIITJEE for school and I’m currently attending KMJT for college. Over time, I’ve built a strong interest in developing AI models, especially for fashion-related applications.One of my proudest projects is a fashion tech ecosystem that integrates cutting-edge features like sketch-to-image generation and AI-powered clothing design. I’m now expanding my skillset into app development, bringing these innovative tools to life in real-world applications.",
"Chandrahaas":"I major in Computer Science and Engineering at KMIT,where im in my third year.Ever since I came into college I wanted to pick a niche for my myself before i graduate. This led me to explore different technology stacks and languages. I worked on multiple projects involving fields like Microservices, MERN stack and python web frameworks like flask and fastAPI. Im also into deep leanring and machine learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.I've worked on multiple projects involving these fr"}
